The Cat brand is the cornerstone of the Caterpillar brand portfolio, representing products and services made by Caterpillar. While Caterpillar was founded in 1925, “Cat” was not used as a trademark until 1949 when it began appearing on machine trade dress. It was registered three years later. Over time, the level of familiarity with the Cat brand made it possible to rely on it as a primary public-facing brand name.
